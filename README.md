# CatboyAddons

CatboyAddons is a Hypixel Skyblock QoL mod (aka. hacked client) introducing innovative and reimagined features.

## Feature List

Every feature in this mod is Use At Your Own Risk, and I'm not responsible for anyone getting banned.

The '⚠️' icon means that the mod is "ban on spec", and that you're at more risk when using it. It's blatant and a red flag to staff.

### Dungeons

#### General
- **Secure Option**
  - You can completely disable modules that are spec ban (aka. staff will ban you for)
  - That's a good option to keep hacking but not having to worry about getting banned
- **Shortbow Pull Fix**
  - Prevents your bow from charging up if you have an arrow in your inventory

#### Dungeons
- **Auto Refill**
  - Automatically refill you in enderpearls & inflatable jerries whenever you run low
- **Auto Potion Bag**
  - Automatically open the potion bag at the start of a run

#### F7 Phase 3 (Goldor)
- **Core Clip** ⚠️
  - Go through the Core Entrance (that one gold door) like it never existed
- **Terminal ESP**
  - Render inactive terminals, levers and devices.
  - ❗ Small visual glitch, nothing important
- **Terminal Aura** ⚠️
  - Automatically open terminals when going near them
- **Auto Terms**
  - Automatically click in terminals to solve them
  - ⚠️ You're able to walk while doing the terminal 
  - ⚠️ Invwalk wasn't tested, use it at your own risk
- **P3 Auto Leap**
  - Automatically leap to the best player possible in Phase 3
  - Is available for I4, SSC, EE1, EE2, EE3, Core, and Tunnel leap
  - Unlike other implementations, the leap is not based on the players' name or class, but on their position, making it work with any party

# CatboyAddons

CatboyAddons is a Hypixel Skyblock QoL mod (aka. hacked client) introducing innovative and reimagined features.

### Feature List

Every feature in this mod is Use At Your Own Risk, and I'm not responsible for anyone getting banned.

The '⚠️' icon means that the mod is "ban on spec", and that you're at more risk when using it. It's blatant and a red flag to staff.

- **Core Clip** ⚠️
  - Go through the Core Entrance with ease in the Maxor phase (P3)
- **Auto Terms**
  - Automatically click in terminals to solve them
  - ⚠️ You're able to walk while doing the terminal 
  - ⚠️ It wasn't tested, use it at your own risk
- **P3 Auto Leap**
  - Automatically leap to the best player possible in Phase 3
  - Is available for I4, SSC, EE1, EE2, EE3, Core, and Tunnel leap
  - Unlike other implementations, the leap is not based on the players' name or class, but on their position, making it work with any party
